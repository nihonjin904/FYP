Project Title: 
Arcane Souls: Rebirth 

Project Objectives 
Please describe the creative/artistic and technical objective of the proposed project. 

Creative/Artistic Objective: 

The creative and artistic objective of Arcane Souls: Rebirth is to craft an immersive, visually stunning 
2D anime-style action-adventure game inspired by the challenging and atmospheric essence of Sekiro: 
Shadows Die Twice. The project aims to blend intricate, hand-drawn anime aesthetics with a dark, 
mystical narrative set in a fantastical world steeped in lore, rebirth, and arcane mysteries. The goal is to 
evoke a sense of awe and emotional depth through detailed character designs, vibrant yet haunting 
environments, and a cinematic storytelling approach. Players will experience a journey of self-discovery 
and resilience, with fluid animations and expressive art that enhance the intense, skill-based combat 
inspired by Sekiro. The artistic vision emphasizes a balance between beauty and brutality, creating a 
unique "二次元" (anime-style) experience that resonates with fans of both anime and challenging 
action games. 

Technical Objective: 

The technical objective of Arcane Souls: Rebirth is to leverage the capabilities of Unreal Engine 5 to 
deliver a high-performance, visually polished 2D game with seamless gameplay mechanics. The project 
will utilize Unreal Engine 5’s advanced rendering features, such as Lumen for dynamic lighting and 
Nanite for detailed asset creation, adapted for a 2D anime-style framework. The focus will be on 
developing precise, responsive combat systems that replicate the punishing yet rewarding mechanics of 
Sekiro, including parrying, dodging, and timing-based attacks. The technical pipeline will prioritize 
optimization for smooth performance across platforms, integrating tools like Unreal’s Paper 2D for 
sprite-based animation and Blueprint scripting for rapid prototyping of game mechanics. Additionally, 
the project will implement robust AI for challenging enemy behaviors and a modular level design 
system to ensure scalability and ease of content updates.

Project Description 
An abstract of 300 - 500 words to illustrate the conceptual framework, an overall description of the project, 
problem, specification, and the associated citation & reference list. (Important Note: Click here for the note of 
Academic Honesty)  

In the evolving landscape of video game development, Arcane Souls: Rebirth represents a pioneering 
endeavor to merge the punishing yet rewarding combat mechanics of FromSoftware's Sekiro: Shadows 
Die Twice with a vibrant 2D anime aesthetic, creating a unique action-adventure experience. This project, 
developed using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), seeks to revitalize the 2D game genre by addressing the gap 
between high-fidelity 3D titles and stylized, narrative-driven 2D games that emphasize emotional depth 
and skill mastery. At its core, the game follows a lone warrior's journey through a mystical world of 
rebirth and arcane secrets, where death is not an end but a catalyst for growth, echoing the themes of 
resilience and precision found in souls-like games. 

The conceptual framework draws from the souls-like genre's emphasis on deliberate, timing-based 
gameplay, where every encounter demands strategic parrying, dodging, and counterattacking, rather 
than relying on brute force or leveling systems. This is infused with anime-inspired artistry, featuring 
exaggerated expressions, fluid animations, and a color palette that balances ethereal beauty with dark, 
foreboding atmospheres to heighten immersion and emotional resonance. The narrative framework 
revolves around cycles of reincarnation, exploring philosophical questions of identity and fate, 
presented through cinematic cutscenes and environmental storytelling. Artistically, the project 
prioritizes hand-drawn sprites and particle effects to evoke a "二次元" (2D anime) style, distinguishing 
it from photorealistic trends in modern gaming. 

A key problem this project addresses is the underrepresentation of challenging 2D games in 
contemporary markets, where 3D engines like UE5 are predominantly used for realistic simulations, 
often overlooking 2D's potential for expressive, accessible design. Technical challenges include adapting 
UE5's advanced features—such as Lumen dynamic lighting and Nanite virtualized geometry—for a 2D 
framework, which traditionally favors lighter engines. This creates issues in performance optimization, 
sprite rendering, and integrating complex AI for enemy behaviors that mimic Sekiro's aggressive, 
pattern-based foes. Additionally, bridging anime visual styles with interactive gameplay requires 
innovative solutions to maintain fluidity without compromising artistic integrity, a common hurdle in 
anime-influenced game design. 

Project specifications outline a core loop centered on exploration, combat, and progression. Key 
features include a posture-based combat system inspired by Sekiro, where breaking an enemy's guard 
leads to decisive strikes; procedurally assisted level design for replayability; and cross-platform 
compatibility targeting PC and consoles. UE5's Paper 2D toolkit will handle sprite animations, while 
Blueprints enable rapid prototyping of mechanics like resurrection nodes that allow players to respawn 
with retained knowledge. The game will support resolutions up to 4K, with a target frame rate of 60 
FPS, and incorporate accessibility options such as adjustable difficulty for parry timings. Development 
milestones include alpha testing for combat balance and beta for narrative integration, ensuring a 
polished release that honors its inspirations while innovating in the 2D space. 

Overall, Arcane Souls: Rebirth not only pays homage to Sekiro's mastery but pushes boundaries in anime-
game fusion, offering players a deeply engaging world that challenges both skill and perception. 
Through meticulous design and technical prowess, this project aims to contribute to the discourse on 
hybrid game genres, fostering new avenues for creative expression in interactive media.
